# Simple Calculator Game
## A fake calculator program 
My first attempt at creating a program with no formal education.  
Implementating while loops, conditionals, functions, user inputs, exceptions and humour.  
To be run in the command line. Python 3 is needed.

### __Walkthrough__
* Enter __text__ instead of numbers in math operations to get a message;
* Enter __any unexpected command__ to get a message;
* Enter command ___hack___ to get a wall of __El Psy Congroo__ (Steins;Gate reference);
* Operations always return 69.0;
* Quit officially through ___quit___ to get a wall of __Quit!__.
